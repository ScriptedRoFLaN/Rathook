# Goals
* Implement **Rich presence** with marquee and custom strings.
* Implement **Smart NavBot** that decently understands its surroundings.
* Implement **Intel Defend** which defends the intel or point if it has moved or been capped at not back at 0.
* Implement **Modes: Look at path** with **Smooth**, **Simple** and **Snappy** for Navbot.
* Fix common issues related to cathooks **Performance**, **Cleanliness**, **Readablility** and **Reliability** including code format, general looks and feel and other things.
* Implement **Auto zoom** for Navbot only.
* Implement **Doubletap** for Warp, and also rename Warp to **Speed Hack** as they are completely different things.
* Implement **Auto Retry** (Inspired by EGH).
* Upgrade the **Resolver**, **Anti-Aim** and add more expandability to what you can change to it.
* Implement **Disable Nullnexus** (Probably not needed anymore since most bots don't use Nullnexus).
* Implement **Low Health: Call Medic** when you are low on health, and also calls medic if the medic is close enough to you.
* Remove **Duplicate Code** which has been know to hog performance.
* Update CXX to 23 and also fix other CMAKE related things.
* Add offsets for **Resupply Cabinet** for Navbot to find when in need of health.
* Remove git-checks and other git things to make each git install of this project isloted to itself.
* ~~Automatically install NavMeshes.~~
* Prevent NavBot from getting stuck while attacking sentrys, dying instantly.
* Fix Aimbot being inaccurate to the point its actually not good.
* Fix angles as they are broken and do allow for slient and other aa features to work.

# Impossible Goals (Maybe)
* Add **Imgui** as a replacer for the gui currently used, and replace things like the config loader to compensate for this.
* Reformat folders to be more organized.
* Change names of almost all files to be more organized.
